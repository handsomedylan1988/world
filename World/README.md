# World - a high-quality speech analysis, manipulation and synthesis system

WORLD is free software for high-quality speech analysis, manipulation and synthesis.
It can estimate Fundamental frequency (F0), aperiodicity and spectral envelope
and also generate the speech like input speech with only estimated parameters.

This source code is released under the modified-BSD license.
There is no patent in all algorithms in WORLD.

## [WIP] - New synthesis function for real-time applications is implementing (2016/03/17).

I'm afraid that no pull request is accepted until this implementaion is completed.
Since the old function is not removed from the project, you can use both of them as necessary.
